Bertifier
=========

Bertifier is a tabular visualization tool.

## Building bertifier

Currently no build step is required. [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is used as a dependency management tool and launcher for tests only (this may change).

## Tests

Tests are based on Jasmine and Selenium (for browser-based tests).

Test dependencies may be installed by running `npm install`.

To run the tests, run `npm test`.
